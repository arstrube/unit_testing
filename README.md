unit_testing
============

Example code originally from this [training](http://www.verifysoft.com/en_ctcpp_training.html), 
which makes use of the minimalistic [ucunit](https://github.com/ucunit/ucunit) unit testing framework.

The tests are being gradually expanded in a test-driven manner with a goal of 100% branch coverage.

An attempt is also made to make it more behavior-driven at the same time, and to reduce the 
(non-verbose) output so the original behaviors being tested become more obvious.
